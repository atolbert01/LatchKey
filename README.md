DESCRIPTION:

Latch Key Quest is a single-player, top-down, action game in which the player completes a series of linear challenge rooms before fighting the final boss and exiting the dungeon. The player can walk in eight directions, roll to avoid projectiles/traps, block, and attack. Unlike traditional hack and slash games, the player does not have a sword or melee weapon, but instead finds a magic shield in the dungeon. Using the shield the player can block (by holding the shield button) or throw the shield as an attack (by releasing the shield button). Once the shield has been thrown it will ricochet off of walls and enemies until the player presses the shield button once again recalling it back to the player as would a boomerang to the player's hand. The shield ricochet is highly predictable and can be used to string together hits or to solve puzzles. While the shield is deployed the player cannot block and must be careful to avoid taking any damage as there is no energy meter and a single hit means instant death. When the player dies the current room must be restarted.

Each room may contain:

●	Hazards - Objects which kill the player. Unlike enemies, traps cannot be destroyed by the player. Spikes, pits, saws, etc. are examples of Hazards.

●	Enemies - Objects which have offensive behaviors and can kill the player. Enemies can be destroyed by the player.

●	Switches - The player must activate the switch in order to exit the room.

●	An Exit - The door to the next room which can be opened when the player has activated all switches..

The game is over when:

●	The player runs out of lives.

●	The final room is completed.

Gameplay:

Latch Key Quest is a top-down arcade-style action puzzle game where in you must complete a series of challenge rooms before completing the final room and exiting the dungeon.

Taking damage from enemies or traps results in instant death. When you die you’ll lose a life and will have to restart the current level.

The objective in each room is very simple, open the portal and exit the room.

Controls:

The player has the ability to roll to dodge projectiles and certain hazards, the ability to block enemy attacks, and the ability to launch a shield projectile attack to damage enemies and activate switches.

Hold the attack button to block incoming attacks, release the button to throw the shield as a projectile attack. Hitting the attack button while the shield is deployed will cause it to return to the player, making it available to block or throw again.

While blocking, regular movement is disabled, however it is possible to roll to evade unblockable attacks and hazards.

After the shield has been deployed in attack mode it will ricochet off of walls and enemies. During shield deployment it is impossible to attack so be wary. It is imperative to master the shield throwing technique both to dispatch enemies, solve puzzles, and activate switches.

Keyboard:
Roll  - “Right Shift”, “Z”

Story Synopsis
It's a beautiful summer day in the park. A boy and his dog play fetch with a stick in a clearing. The boy throws the stick toward a wooded thicket and the dog chases after it. When the dog returns he holds in his mouth a strange, glowing disc. The boy, perceiving only an ordinary flying disc, throws it into the woods and is startled when a mysterious rift opens where the disc lands. The dog runs after it diving head first into the strange opening! The boy looks at it in disbelief. It's eerie. It looks like a portal to another world! The boy hesitates standing before the rift. Suddenly, the portal seems to lurch, reaching out and pulling him in.

You awaken in an unfamiliar place. Walls of ancient-looking bricks sprout from the ground and pools of boiling lava adorn the landscape. Whirling from out of the shadows, seemingly of its own volition, the mysterious disc snaps to your side. It glows warmly and you sense it imploring you to delve further into this strange and bewildering place. You hear your dog barking in the distance and know what you must do. You take the disc in your hands as your shield and are swallowed by the sprawling dungeon.
